# VerilogRiscVCore
Simple rv32i core written in verilog. Has been tested both on cyclone 6 and on verilator and should work correctly. I did make this quite a while ago and honestly don't remember if this passed the tests in riscv-tests repo but i do remember it at least ran gcc compiled c and c++ code no issues.
